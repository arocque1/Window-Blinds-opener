# Window-Blinds-opener
Arduino code that opens my window blinds at sunrise, or any time I set.

Here a video showing the functionality:

The first clip shows the motor starting at 3:53PM, opening the blinds until
fully opened, just over a minute later. The second clip shows the IR remote
functionality. I programmed 4 buttons on the remote: 2 that open and close the 
blinds while I am pressing the button, and 2 that toggle the opening and closing.
The first 2 buttons I press are opening and closing the blinds while I hold the 
respective button, while the last 2 buttons I press respectively toggle the opening
and closing.
